# cve-2019-0604-SP2010-netv3.5

Recently, I came across a Sharepoint 2010 SP2 and all the Proof of Concept that I tested didn't work until I realized that
the server was on .net 3.5 which require a different library. 

Here is the .dll for .net 3.5. The code came from https://github.com/linhlhq/CVE-2019-0604. It will generate the 
serialize payload.
